Sanawy Bible Study Management System - Backend API
-------------------------------------------------

This is a scaffolded Node.js + Express + MongoDB backend created automatically.

How to run:

1. Install dependencies:
   cd bible-sanawy-api
   npm install

2. Edit .env if you want (it already contains provided MongoDB URI & email credentials).

3. Start server:
   npm run dev     # if you have nodemon
   OR
   npm start

The API servers on port 6060 by default. Endpoints are under /api/*

Security note:
- The .env in this package contains the MongoDB URI and email credentials you provided. Keep it safe.
